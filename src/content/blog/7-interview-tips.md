## NOTE

I am not someone who has cracked top products based co. or 1 cr remote package.

All these below mentioned points are my own opinions and experineces that i encountered while giving interviews for service based co. , small startups and a few product based co. like cars24 , fabhotels etc.

I had cracked 2 offers last month one for a UK based client and one with a health care startup that got funded recently.

Hence i feel comfortable writing a general experince over here and share with you. Also you might find some grammar or spelling issues while reading hope you wont bother much about it since i do not use chatgpt to generate such blogs. I prefer writing my raw thoughts

## Exaggerate

In interviews, i often explained stuff that i have actually worked on and used to omit or shy away from explaining things that i havent worked on but i knew about them or how some tools , libs can be achived to get a specific task done.

During this one interview, te interviewer told me that speak out everything you know about that particular thing that he asked.

He told me they want to select candidates and not reject them.

Hence in all my upcoming interviews, i exaggerated, told each and evrything in details. the tradeoffs of using and implementing a particular tool or techinique, the alteratives, even things that i knew a lot about but never got a chance to implement practically.

And this helped me cleared a lot of initial rounds in comaoinies like cars24 too.

## Shoot a lot of DMs to the founders

I often find myself lazying around while applyoing for the job since i felt that the market is too bad currently, but a few weeks ago i created a template for cold dms for three roles

To the founders
To the employee
To the HRs/ recruiters

and started shooting dms directly to them specially to the founders and to my surprise i got a 3 out 3 responses back.

Though 3 is quite a less number and that because i am getting very less time bcz of my current intitaives - that is hiretales that i am building but i am planning to level up the game and shoot actively.

Please take help of chatgpt and create a template of your own and keep it handy in a notion doc or something.

## Prepare your past work deeply

If you even have an year of experince or you boasted about your side projects during the interview, then dont get stunned if the interviewer grill you down on that. I made a complete notion template of my past work experince, joting down every follow up questions they can ask, the challenging task that i did and a lot more thing.

## Your virtual presence matter a lot than you think

We talk virtaul interviews quite casually, specialy when it comes to the dress sense, the lighting, the entire enviorenment that is visibkle. But this casual ness can cause a damage that you might not be aware off. Your presentation matters a fucking lot even in the virtual interviews.

## Career Gaps fade away when you have the skills

Career gaps can hppen because of N number of reasons, in my case it happened initally when i was preparing for the Airforce exam, then a family member of mine was diagnosed with somehting serious.

But these career gaps can fade when you build somehting, during this time.

I mentioned the work i did during these times clearly and 8 out 10 comapnies never bothered about the gaps deeply once i mentioned how i kept myself updated during the gap periods.

## Please stop taking rejections tooooooo seriously

Since the beginning of my career i never took any rejections to my heart. Because once things get to the heart they are hard to heal.

Instead i always focussed on what questions i could not answer during the interviews. And prepared them well to make sure i explain that concept clearly if asked again in any interview.

> Rememeber : its okay to fail in an interview but its not okay to fail again for the same reason

## Reschedule the interview

Searching or switching jobs is tiring, it drains energy. Reaserching comaonies, applying, mutliple rounds of interviews, rejections etc.

And it csn sometmes leave you exhausted for an upcoming interview.

Rescheduling an interview is much better than attending the interview in an exhausted state. A break and recharge will help you prepare better and ansswer better in an interview.

Thats it for now, i will keep updating this post with all other experiences.
