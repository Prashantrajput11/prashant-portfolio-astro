## NOTE

I am not someone who has cracked top products based co. or 1 cr remote package.

All these below mentioned points are my own opinions and experineces that i encountered while giving interviews for service based co. , small startups and a few product based co. like cars24 , fabhotels etc.

I had cracked 2 offers last month one for a UK based client and one with a health care startup that got funded recently.

Hence i feel comfortable writing a general experince over here and share with you. Also you might find some grammar or spelling issues while reading hope you wont bother much about it since i do not use chatgpt to generate such blogs. I prefer writing my raw thoughts

It's been almost 3 years in this IT field hence i decided to reflect back on my journey and share my learnings, up and downs , and what im looking for further

## My first Org

I intially started with NIIT Ltd. as an associate software engineer.

But the work was mostly low code, we used a tool called Lectora to build prdocuts for a client - Shell.

I worked here for almost 5 months and and during this period i keep learning web dev side by side as i was actively looking for opportunities that involves code.

## My second org - a startup developing POS

This was my first co where i was actually coding things, initially i worked on backend also.
The tech stack we used here included Node, express , aws for deployments and database, react native for frontend side
I was primalriy involved in designing schemas for cash settlements, attendance related schemas for store workers, etc.

I learnt some fundamnetal of sql here and also got to explore dynamo DB and cloud watch for log insights

Then i moved to the frontend side of things where i started to work on react native and react native web.

I was quite happy with this role as frontend is somehting i loved that time.

I built 80+ screens in a few months and integrated backend apis for hardware like printers, KOT, POS, CFD ( customer facing display etc)

The POS we built is being used by TacoBell.

## Joining a mental health startup

It was an amazing decision to join this one since i was the only dev who would handle all the frotned stuff.

In my previous co. where we were building POS i was at junior role and the frontend team was quite big that i had to proactively asks for task. And that was appreciated my the CTo and founders.

Anyway talking about this current org here we initally used React Native, Tanstack query with supabase and later migrated to mongoDb.

It was fun implementing features, shipping fast and working late nights

I leanrt zustand, tan stack query here since our app relied mostly on tanstack query

It is a really good lib for fetching server state.

and zustand is great for managing the global UI state that is left

I integrated few SDKs like FCM for push notifications, sentry for error logs, supabaase sdk , used web sockets for real time communication since we had a chat feature involved.

and a lot of other cool react native libs for media managament, social logins etc

I implemented one o one chat, and premium communities chat that wa a huge success and increased so much engagement int he app.

Working closely with the founders and CTOs makes you a lot smarter since you start thinking all the trade offs, the ripplke effects and pyschology of users. That helps in marketing the product

So this was it in this blog. Thnaks for reading.
