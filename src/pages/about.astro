		Hey there! I'm Prashant â€” a React Native Engineer passionate about building meaningful products that actually solves pains of users. I work primarily with React Native and have been actively shaping ideas into mobile apps that people can use every day.

	<p>
		My recent projects include apps that help users share their interview stories, book mental health counselors, and even unwind with relaxing sounds. I stay close to the community by learning, sharing ideas, and constantly improving my craft.

		Outside of code, I enjoy reflecting on life, writing small poems, and going nostalgic about my childhood days spent flying kites or biking around my old neighborhood. I try to carry that curiosity and joy into everything I build.
